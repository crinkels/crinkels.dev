  Keep learning something new on each iteration of your side project to keep yourself motivated

I am doing web development for over 10 years. It all started with a free university license of Photoshop that got me into web design. I came to realize that if I wanted my designs coming to live on the web, I had to learn HTML and CSS to make it happen. Photoshop and some web development became a hobby of mine. Around the same time, I found another hobby: writing.

I always was, and still am, a big fan of games. In 2008 someone approached me to be a writer for a small website that was starting known as [PlayWatchRead](https://www.playwatchread.nl/). Within no time, I also became involved in the design and development of the website which I kept doing until the tenth anniversary of the website in 2018.

Ever since I tried to find a balance between my hobbies to start something. For years I had an on-off relationship with my WordPress website, which was never shipped. Only recently I could put my website live and start using it. Okay, I have to admit; it was on a back burner for a few years. But over the years, I had a hard time maintaining my motivation to deliver the final product. So how did I find my motivation and kept it the last time?

## Start small

Balancing your time for side-projects or hobbies is very difficult. It does not matter if it's a painting, website or podcast. The bigger your initial scope is, the bigger it might fail. Nothing feels worse than failing with something you love.

In all my attempts at setting up a website, I had many goals. I wanted to show the world what I could do, one part should be a blog, and finally, I wanted almost full freedom in styling. Every time I started with WordPress, it failed. Why? Because both my goals were too big, and WordPress was too big to achieve some of my goals.

Luckily for me, we live in a post-WordPress world for building websites. A static website is easy to set up these days is so much easier compared to a few years ago. But choosing the initial technical structure only solves half the problem. I had to reduce the scope, without losing sight of my goal.

> Reduce your initial scope, without losing sight of your original goal

When I followed my original website idea, it would take me days if not weeks to make. This would ensure that I would lose my motivation, _again_. So I asked myself, what would be a smallest result that could keep me motivated? I enjoy tinkering around in the website code and be able to write a blog post now and then. So why not start with a page that shows a list of blog posts, and a page that shows a single blog post?

## Small iterations

I now had my initial version of my website finally pushed live. It even had a first blog post! Now what? I had and still have so many ideas. Both for my website and posts, I can write. It's daunting to see the immense list of stuff I would like to write and incorporate. Especially because it was on two very different levels: writing and programming.

To keep my motivation, I made a deal with myself. As my professional career revolves around programming, my priority would be writing. But, with every article I write, I will implement one idea for my website or something related to it. To give you some idea, these are some of my iterations.

- On my second blog post, I implemented a dark theme for my website;
- After that, I improved upon the SEO, which learned me some great new stuff;
- Next was improvements on social media sharing (e.g. ability to set an image for sharing on Twitter);
- In my last post, I created various components in Figma to create consistent diagrams. This learned me a lot about the constraint system in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).

What? That last one has nothing to do with my website. It does not have to be a change on the website, as long as it impacts the website. So by changing my focus to Figma, I learned some new things that I can use.

## Prioritize

But what will be my next iterations? I try to prioritize my blog posts and improvements. There are two important aspects that have impact on prioritizing. First and most important: The stuff that I am most excited about is getting the highest priority. Second, I try to combine an improvement to my website with the next blog post I write.

My website is growing in content and visitors. So I have two options in that regard already. I can make a 'pinned' article section to ensure that my favorite posts are always accessible. Another option is to create an 'about me' page, to provide more context about myself. I decided to ship the first feature together with this article.

> My priorities change, and they change often

My priorities change, and they change often. As like many of you, I can get excited about completely something new whenever I read a new blog post of someone else. I use this peak excitement to boost my motivation. So my priorities have to change, and they change often. This is a good thing, as I guide my priorities based on my motivation. When you force work on yourself, even when it is something you like, you can lose motivation quicker.

## Seek feedback on your work

My priorities change not only because of other blog posts I read. Often I get inspiration for new posts and improvements to my website based on feedback. I share my work with my wife, my friends and my colleagues for initial feedback. But I share my work in different communities. Here I get my most important feedback.

I started with the designs of my [logo](https://dribbble.com/shots/6709595-Personal-Brand-Logo-V2) and a [digital drawing](https://dribbble.com/shots/6815153-CSS-Owl-selector) on Dribbble. I share my writing on [The Practical Dev](https://dev.to). Especially for the latter, comments and discussions on my articles have inspired me to follow up on articles. Because of the constructive discussions, I have a high motivation to write those. This means that my priorities shift based on the comments of my readers!

## What keeps you motivated?

As you can read, there is a flow or process in how I could finally get my website started and keep my motivation going. How do you keep motivated about your hobbies and side projects? Let me know on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/vyckedev)!
