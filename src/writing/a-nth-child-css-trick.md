  A little CSS trick that allows you to use nth-child values in the CSS calc() function.
---

Sometimes you figure out a cool trick that just feels so powerful. It opens you up to a range of new possibilities. That you, quite frankly, rarely use. But still, it is a cool trick. For me, the latest of these tricks is setting a CSS custom property value, corresponding with the `:nth-child` value. Why? Because now we can use the `--nth-child` custom property inside `calc()` functions.

## But why not use X?

Sure, in most, if not all, of my projects I use SCSS instead of CSS. But CSS is getting more and more features, making SCSS redundant for me. Looking at you [CSS nesting](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-nesting-1/). With each trick or implementation, you can remove another dependency on SCSS, and go back to plain CSS. Using `@for-`loops makes it easy to achieve the same result. But you will generate roughly the same CSS selector several times.

You might also think using `:nth-child(n)` would allow you to achieve the same, without all the custom properties. Unfortunately, the `n` is not useable in the `calc()` function. So, we use custom properties.

Lastly, there is also the `counter()` function, as pointed out by [Šime Vidas](https://elk.zone/mastodon.world/@simevidas@mastodon.social/109752614707368503). This is a powerful function that has a lot of other attributes that can be set, like a reset of the counter. However, this one is also not available in the `calc()` function.

## How to set it up

On the highest level of your CSS, you define a list like the one below. This results in all elements having access to a `--nth-child` custom property. At least as long as you don’t exceed the length of your list.

```css
:nth-child(1) {
	--nth-child: 1;
}
:nth-child(2) {
	--nth-child: 2;
}
:nth-child(3) {
	--nth-child: 3;
}
:nth-child(4) {
	--nth-child: 4;
}
:nth-child(5) {
	--nth-child: 5;
}
```

## What can we do with this trick?

Glad you asked! In the last few years, I came across two use cases. Two, whole, use cases. In the latest use case, I wanted to automatically generate a color palette. Not to match a branding of a company. But to automatically populate different series of data in a chart. With this trick, we can do that with a single line.

```css
background-color: hsl(calc(100 * var(--nth-child)) 100% 40%);
```

In an earlier use case, I replicated the UI implementation of toasts from [Vercel](https://vercel.com/design/toast). On the link, you see a list of toast messages stacked with a little bit of perspective. I originally used an SCSS implementation, looking like the snippet below. Note it uses `:nth-last-of-type`, given the reversed order and bottom orientation. But the general idea remains the same.

```scss
@for $i from 1 through 20 {
	&:nth-of-type(#{$i}) {
		opacity: 1 - 0.15 * ($i - 1);
		transform: translate3d(50%, 0 - (5 * ($i - 1)) + px, -1 * $i + px)
			scale(1 - (0.05 * ($i - 1)));
	}
}
```

This would create twenty different CSS selectors, all with a different value for `$i`. But using this little trick, we can reduce the code, and make it more maintainable in the process.

```css
.class {
	/* We want to start counting at 0 */
	--v: var(--nth-child) - 1;
	opacity: 1 - calc(var(--v) * 0.15);
	transform:
		translate3d(
			50%,
			calc(-5px * var(--v)),
			calc(-1px * var(--v))
		scale(calc(1 - var(--v) * 0.05);
}
```

That was it. That was my latest CSS trick.
