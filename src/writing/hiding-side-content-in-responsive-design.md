  A trick to hide content in specific responsive layout patterns without the need for media queries. But with a few gotchas.
---

I always love solutions that allow me to achieve the same results where others choose for media queries. I am not opposed to media queries. But, in line with Andy Bell’s *[be the browser’s mentor, not its micro-manager](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5uhIiI9Ld5M)*, I feel media queries are very specific rules. We can live (mostly) without them!

## How does it work?
There are two types of responsive layout patterns I can think of where you can use this trick. It’s the *switcher* and *sidebar* patterns from [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev). Both layouts automatically switch from horizontal to vertical if there is not enough room left to uphold the conditions. Below is an illustration of the *switcher* layout below.

Both these layout patterns do not use media queries to achieve their results. The boundary condition in both these patterns is that they start with a wrapper like the one below. 

```css
.my-layout {
	display: flex;
	flex-wrap: wrap;
}
```

But what if we want to hide one block when we switch to the vertical layout? So in the example below, we want to hide the middle block when we have a smaller screen. Traditionally, we would write a hiding mechanism using media queries (e.g. `@media(max-width: 20rem)`. But there is a way around it.

For this explanation, let’s assume that this block is an `aside` element. To make this work, we need to build our HTML like the snippet below. Yes, you need one additional level inside the `aside` element.

```html
<div class="my-layout">
	<div>...</div>
	<aside><div>...</div></aside>
	<div>...</div>
</div>
```

We start with adding an `align-self: stretch` on the `aside` element. This ensures that in a horizontal orientation, the `aside` assumes the height of the entire row. Next, we add `position: relative` on the `aside` and a `position: absolute` on its child. Combined with the `inset: 0`, we ensure that `aside > *` is usable in a horizontal orientation. The horizontal orientation is now complete. 

Now for the vertical orientation. With the `position` attributes ensure `aside` has no calculated height in a vertical orientation. The child is taken [out of flow](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flow_Layout/In_Flow_and_Out_of_Flow) due to the `absolute` value. By adding an `overflow: hidden` to the `aside`, we ensure that the child content is hidden in a vertical orientation. You know, due to the zero calculated height. Combined it would look like the code below.

```css
.my-layout > aside {
	align-self: stretch;
	position: relative;
	overflow: hidden;
}

.my-layout > aside > * {
	position: absolute;
	inset: 0;
}
```

## Gotchas
As said, this is a very specific trick, that has a few gotchas.

- If you set a height or min-height on the “parent” it will not work. Once it wraps to a new line, the side content will still be visible. 
- when you set a gap on the wrapper, you will have an unwanted side effect once the content wraps to new lines. Although the side content is not visible, it is part of the DOM. This means that a vertical gap will be applied. Creating a kind of margin-bottom effect.

Although the use case is limited and the gotchas add more limitations, it does have some usage.

This trick also works if we want to reverse horizontal and vertical. If there is no `width` on the horizontal orientation, the content gets hidden. In vertical orientation, it can fill the available space, or have a fixed `height`.
