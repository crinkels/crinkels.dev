## Specialism as a service

It takes time to become better at making decisions at each step. I believe it is a combination of knowledge, experience and specialism. The web is moving fast. Keeping up with all aspects is impossible. Being “good enough” on all levels will in the end harm your users. Some level of specialization (e.g. a11y, CSS, databases, design) will be required to build sustainable solutions. The goal is to deliver value for users, nobody else. Introducing the “specialism-as-a-service” model, inspired by [Jared Spool](https://twitter.com/jmspool).

1. **Dark ages**: the specialism is completely absent throughout the entire organisation or team(s).
2. **Ad-hoc**: one employee applies the specialism for the team ad hoc, or a freelancer is hired for a short period (e.g. for a single project).
3. **As-a-service**: a dedicated team (one or more employees) specialized in an area offers their ‘service’ to the other teams. All team activities resolve around helping other teams within the expert domain, or improve their skills.
4. **Embedded**: a dedicated resource is present in the team. If the dedicated resources are underutilized, they spend their time improving their skills.
5. **Infused**: the entire team is able to make decisions and provide input.

If you dont move beyond ad-hoc or “as-a-service”, your company will optimize purely for the short-term. If your “specialist” move to another company, they leave a big gap. Often one that is not filled, or you move backwards. Resulting in only general practitioners that cover the infamous “80%” of what is required for the value stream. It results in the entire team never to be embedded or infused on critical knowledge. The end results lack critical stuff.

## State of the industry

- we see many generic practitioners, focused on frameworks.
- young frameworks, but employees move quickly to other languages (e.g. back-end languages).
- People want to to logic, and other parts (a11y) are under developed
- let frameworks & libraries solve our problems, instead of the web-platform itself. How many have used a ‘select’ library, because we want the styles to be different from the browser default? Resulting in worse solutions for users.
- frameworks tend to mask away capabilities of the browser. How long was bootstrap popular, only for their 12 column layout? cSs Grid is over 10 years old!
- CSS improved much over the years, and continues to do so. Replacing already a lot what required SCSS or JS in the past.
