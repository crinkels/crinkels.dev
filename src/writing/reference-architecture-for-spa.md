  A reference architecture for SPA front-ends with React and Angular, focused on principles instead of rules.
---

In my day job I focus a lot less directly on CSS and the "front-of-the-front-end". In reality, I build a lot of B2B applications, or back-office applications, where SPA (e.g. using React or Angular) has become a standard. For me, that is no acception. Within this work, I have created an elaborate "reference architecture" with some example code as well. It works in React and Angular (in combination with Angular best practices).

The goal of this architecture is not to set rigid rules, but enable everybody to make decisions based on solid principles, or divert from then with good reason.

The latest version was released around a month ago!
