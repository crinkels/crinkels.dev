  <p>
    I am a front-end engineer and <a href="/writing">writer</a> specializing
    in CSS architecture & software quality. Crinkles is my after-hours digital
    playground â€” my <a href="/projects">corner</a> of the internet.

  <p>A crinkle crankle wall is an unusual type of structural or garden wall built in a serpentine shape with alternating curves. Its structure helps to resist lateral forces, leading to greather strength to normal straight walls. They use less bricks than multi-layer walls to gain the same strength.</p>

  <p>Crinkles. creates UI solutions for users and developers with this same <i>anti-fragile</i> mindset. Software solutions should be of high quality, but implemented with effective patterns and methods.</p>
