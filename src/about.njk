        I am a Dutch front-end focused software engineer and engineering
        manager. During my studies I came into contact with the C and C++
        programming languages, and I hated it. I vowed to never do anything in
        programming ever again. But soon after I found a love for web
        development, especially the visual implementation. That was 15+ years
        ago and never looked back.

        A few years back I started this after-hours digital playground - my
        corner of the internet. It is the place where I experiment and innovate.
        Looking for lean implementations to existing problems on the web.
