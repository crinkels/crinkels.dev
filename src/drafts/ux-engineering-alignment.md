Almost two years ago I wrote my [first blogpost](/writing/ux-design-process-for-engineers) on this website about the alignment between UX and engineering. I got my inspiration based on a conference talk of [Steph Troeth](https://twitter.com/sniffles) on the [CSS Day of 2019](https://cssday.nl/2019). Since that time, I learned a lot by working with UX designers. Although my initial ideas did not change, I did got a more complete picture of what the alignment between UX and engineering should and could be.

## Delivery vs. Discovery

Agile gave us engineers many things. Its promise allowed engineers to start focusing on things that actually matter for them, that add value to a product. Things like performance, reliability, scalability and security are now at the fore-front of many engineering teams. In addition, work is made smaller, so engineers can more comfortably give some sort of indication how much effort it requires. Businesses gain more productivity and predictability in _delivering_ software that actually works.

This works perfectly well in stable environments where the focus is on existing IT landscapes, with no big appetite for change. Change is scary and unpredictable. I mean, who could ever break a venture into uncharted territories in effective user stories. Let alone actually doing such user stories in a two week window? Agile's focus on delivery makes it difficult to really tap into big changes.

But innovation regardless if it is for a potentially new or existing solution, requires change. It is a _discovery_ journey to find something valuable, usable, feasible and viable for a given problem. Sometimes we know the destination but not the path. But more often we just get a hunch of the direction. UX plays a big part in these ventures into the unknown. They can act as a business' navigator, showing us which paths to follow to find not a destination, but the correct destination.

## Design

I think it is fair to assume that as engineers we spent most of our time in delivery, while our UX colleagues are on discovery. At some point, we need to come together and align. Both need to enable the other to do a better job than they already did. Engineers can create products that enable UX designers to easily extract metrics that help them make better decisions. On the other hand, UX designers can enable engineers to create better products faster, by providing systems they can implement and use in decision making. The primary alignment happens in a _design_ step.

Design is more than just creating UI designs and hand them over. Design starts with a set of requirements found during the discovery phase. Engineers and UX designers come together to design (a part of) a solution. By working together, effective models can be created that only together can be seen as the design of a solution. When these models are disjoint, issues will arise during the delivery phase. Either by poor quality, or a poor response of users. Some examples of models that can be created by UX designers and engineers are:

- Architecture and infrastructure design
- Information architecture
- User-, screen- and system-flows
- Design systems

By just looking at these names, most of you will already see the importance of the various models. By putting enough time and focus in the design phase, many future issues can be avoided. It also creates greater understanding and alignement between UX designers and engineers. But, we live in an agile world. In this world, the primary focus is on delivery only. As a team it is important to take the time required to do proper discovery and design.

## Feedback cycles

When you move one phase, there is always the possibility that you have to move back. Based on activities in _design_, you might have too many unanswered questions. You have to do some research again to be able to move ahead. But even after you finished, feedback will hit you. The shipped product should be equipped with possibilities to measure behavior and capture feedback, that feedback into the process as input. The cycle restarts itself again.

## Wrapping up

This process works for UX + UI, engineering, or the combination of the two.
