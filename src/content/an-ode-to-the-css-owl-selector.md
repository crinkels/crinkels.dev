It is not a secret that I love CSS. A few years ago I fell in love with a very simple, but powerful CSS selector. Back then I was expanding my CSS to the next level. I knew about the specificity and the cascade. I had no issue using CSS from scratch or with a framework. But I came across new CSS selectors for complex solutions. So I had to expand my knowledge on CSS.

I started with finding resources online, like [Smashing Magazine](https://smashingmagazine.com/). There I came across [Heydon Pickering](https://twitter.com/heydonworks) and later his ['lobotomized owl selector'](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/) of . This selector blew my mind. At the [CSS Day](https://cssday.nl/2019), he even showed another beauty, called the ['flexbox holy Albatros'](http://www.heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatross) (you can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUyNJaoJH_k)). These types of solutions showed me that CSS is a lot more powerful than I knew. Solving solutions in CSS can be easy or elegant. So, Heydon, this one is (partly) for you.

## The lobotomized owl selector

Heydon explains the selector better in his [article](https://alistapart.com/article/axiomatic-css-and-lobotomized-owls/) than I can. But I will provide a quick summary. The selector is, as mentioned, very simple: `* + *`. The `*` is the universal selector in CSS, it applies to all elements in the DOM. The `+` is the real hero of this piece of CSS code. It has the beautiful name of ['adjacent sibling combinator'](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Adjacent_sibling_combinator). It applies the defined styles to the _second_ element if immediately follows the _first_ element. With our selector, it applies styles to all non-first elements on the same level in de DOM. Unless other rules have a higher [specificity](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/).

```css
* + * {
	...;
}
```

So why is this selector so powerful? I found the selector when searching for a spacing solution for a blogging website. I wanted to create enough space between paragraphs, but also to their parent element. Many solutions exist to solve this. You can give every element a `margin-bottom`. This has a side effect on the last element. To solve this, override the styles with the `:last-of-type` pseudo-selector. Another solution is to add both a `padding-top` and `padding-bottom` to each paragraph. This can create unwanted side-effects with paddings of the parent element. More in-depth description of this specific problem and solution can be found on [Every Layout](https://every-layout.dev/layouts/stack/), which is a brilliant website.

The `* + *` seems to be an elegant solution when using `margin-top`. The `margin-top` is only applied between the elements. But you can also have images using `img` or `svg` elements which have different spacing. Then try something like `p + p`. You can make this structure as specific as you want, ensuring a simple and elegant solution. But you know what makes it powerful? In this setup, it works on nested elements!

As you can see on the left, the `margin-top` rule applies to every element in the list. On the right, the second element gets not only the styling rule, but it also has two child elements. Of those child elements, the second one also gets the margin.

## Algorithms in UI

You might wonder why I am so obsessed with this little CSS selector? In the web development industry, and at the 2019 CSS Days, there is a reoccurring subject. Is CSS a programming language? For the answer to this question, I recommend the talk of [Lara Schenck](https://twitter.com/laras126), which you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtddBM8s7xY). This talk got me thinking about the state of CSS and how I use it myself. How complex is it for the browser to transform my CSS commands into something shown on the screen?

The owl selector is a wonderful example showing how complex parsing CSS selectors can be. It shows the real power of CSS. Why? Because it works nested. In any programming language, this can become complex fast. The nested nature of the selector can is comparable to [recursion](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)>). Before diving into the recursive solution, let's look at the pseudo-code for a flat list of elements.

_Disclaimer: the code examples used do not work in any programming language, they are pseudo-code snippets._

```js
function owl(list, apply) {
	for (i = 1; i < list.length; i++) {
		apply(list[i]);
	}
}
```

Our function gets a list of elements and an `apply` function as input. As you can see, we start at `1`. Not because arrays start at 1 (they do not), but because our CSS selector skips the first element by default. The function works like `* + *` on a non-nested list. The callback `apply` is used to any element in the list. But what if we want to have something like `p + p` or even `img + p`? We have to add checks to ensure the adjacent elements follow the definition.

```js{1,2,5}
function isFirst(item) { ... }
function isSecond(item) { ... }

function owl(list, apply) {
  for (i = 1; i < list.length; i++) {
    if (isFirst(list[i]) && isSecond(list[i - 1])) {
      apply(list[i]);
    }
  }
}
```

With the function, we can work with lists of varying types of elements and check if adjacent elements fit our criteria. We are only lacking the nesting capabilities of our CSS selector. We could check if our element has any children. If so, we call the `owl` function again. Yet, in HTML any element can have children. This means that even our elements complying with our adjacent rule can have children. So instead of calling the `owl` function if our element has children, we first have to call the `apply` function. So it can happen that for a single element, both `apply` and `owl` are called.

```js{3, 10, 11, 12}
function isFirst(item) { ... }
function isSecond(item) { ... }
function hasChildren(item) { ... }

function owl(list, apply) {
  for (i = 1; i < list.length; i++) {
    if (isFirst(list[i]) && isSecond(list[i - 1])) {
      apply(list[i]);
    }
    if (hasChildren(list[i])) {
      owl(list[i], apply);
    }
  }
}
```

You now know how to create something like our owl selector. It exists of a recursive function with some extra functions to check the conditions. The above pseudo-code can become more complex if our CSS becomes more complex. Try to combine it with different pseudo-selectors, or change its specificity. By doing so, you will see how powerful CSS has become.

## Is CSS a programming language?

As I mentioned, during the CSS Days one of the reoccurring topics was "is CSS a programming language?". Almost everybody can apply simple CSS rules or styling rules. Solving more complex (or even easy) problems require more in-depth knowledge. Knowledge of computer science concepts becomes important, as they are the result of CSS rules.

A simple CSS selector can mean that you apply a recursive function. This is nothing else than using a function written by someone else. The mental model of the result remains the same. You are applying algorithms to create a UI. This is exactly the reason I love CSS. Something simple can become a powerful UI manipulation tool. Every time I find solutions in CSS that I deemed not possible. So I want to thank Heydon Pickering, Lara Schenck and all the others that showed me the real power of CSS.
